Spatiotemporal infectious Disease modelling
This repository is for my final year project work. I am working on estimating and inferring parameters from a spatio-temporal disease model. In this Project, I will be using Probabilistic Programming Language like stan to estimate some parameters of a SEIR model with Metapopulation component then fit it to a COVID-19/Ebola dataset for some West Africa (Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia) countries.
